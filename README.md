# My Bootstrap Portfolio

## My Task

The task was to recreate the portfolio that we have using bootstrap. In this activity a jumbotron section must be used along with cards. It showcases my works so far and when the button is clicked to check out the said work the user will take you to that page. All button have hover effect and for me, the page does look refreshing.


##  Description

This challenge is now a better version of my portfolio by using bootstrap, it is easier since you no longer need to start anew but instead workaround the bootstrap and edit the code to what I want. This portfolio's style is worked around my favorite colors, black grey and blue. The button will have hover effect and when clicked it will to its designated location.

## Mock-Up

The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
